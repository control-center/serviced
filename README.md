serviced
========

Serviced is a PaaS runtime. It allows users to create, manage and scale services
in a uniform way.


Installation
------------
Serviced can run on a single host or across multiple hosts. First, serviced
depends on docker.

1. Follow the instruction at http://www.docker.io/ , to install
   it on every host that serviced will run on. Ensure docker is running.

2. Install a generated package

      sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys AA5A1AD7
ï¿¼     REPO=http://get.zenoss.io/apt/ubuntu
      sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] '${REPO}' trusty universe" \
          > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zenoss.list'
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install -y serviced

   Or follow the steps below in the dev section to a source build.

3. Start the service. On ubuntu,
```bash
start serviced
```
   There will be some delay the first time serviced is started before it is ready
   for user requests. You can track the output of serviced at
   /var/log/upstart/serviced.log.

4. Browse the UI at https://localhost

Usage
-----
Serviced is a platform for running services. Serviced is composed of a master
serviced process and agent processes running on each host. Each host must be registered
with the master process. To register a agent process:
```bash
serviced host add HOST:PORT RESOURCE_POOL
```

Dev Environment
---------------
Serviced is written in go. To install go, download go v1.4 from http://golang.org.
Untar the distribution to /usr/local/go. If you use a different location for go, you
must set GOROOT. See the http://www.golang.org for more information. Ensure that
$GOROOT/bin is in you path.

Add your development user to the "docker" group.
```bash
sudo usermod -G docker -a $USER
```
Ubuntu 14.04 is the typical development environment. There are additional dependencies
your install will need.
```bash
sudo apt-get install git mercurial libpam0g-dev make
```

With $GOROOT set and $GOROOT/bin in your $PATH, create a development workspace.
```bash
export GOPATH=~/mygo
export PATH="$PATH:$GOPATH/bin"
mkdir -p $GOPATH/{bin,pkg,src}
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/control-center
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/control-center
git clone git@github.com:control-center/serviced
    # alternatively: git clone https://github.com/control-center/serviced
cd serviced
make
```

After this, a binary should exist at $GOPATH/bin/serviced &
$GOPATH/src/github.com/control-center/serviced/serviced. You can run the server with

```bash
sudo serviced -master
```

This is a change.
