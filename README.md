serviced
========

Serviced is a PaaS runtime. It allows users to create, manage and scale services
in a uniform way.


Installation
------------
Serviced can run on a single host or across multiple hosts. First, serviced
depends on docker. 

1. Follow the instruction at http://www.docker.io/ , to install 
   it on every host that serviced will run on. Ensure docker is running.

2. Next, follow the instructions in the dev section to create the serviced 
   binary at $GOPATH/github.com/zenoss/serviced/serviced. 

3. Copy serviced binary to a location in your path.

4. One instance of serviced will be the "master". On this host, install the
   MySQL server and client.

5. Download and install elastic search.  Location is irrelvant
   http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/
   
```bash
wget https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-0.90.5.tar.gz
tar xzf elasticsearch-0.90.5.tar.gz
cd elasticsearch-0.90.5
./bin/elasticsearch
```

6. Create the database "cp" on the master and source 
   $GOPATH/github.com/zenoss/serviced/serviced/database.sql in to it. For example:

```bash
mysql -u root cp "source $GOPATH/github.com/zenoss/serviced/serviced/database.sql"
```

7.  Install elasticsearch document models

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/zenoss/serviced/dao/elasticsearch
curl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/controlplane -d @controlplane.json
```

8. Start the master serviced. It can also act as an agent. 

```bash
serviced -agent -master
```

9. Register the agent to the control plane. For example, to register host foo that
   is running serviced on port 4979:
```bash
serviced add-host foo:4979
```

After all the agents are registered, serviced should be working properly. It's time
to define some services.


Usage
-----
Serviced is a platform for running services. Serviced is composed of a master
serviced process and agent processes running on each host. Each host must be registered
with the master process. To register a agent process:

```bash
serviced add-host [HOSTNAME:PORT]
```

After the hosts are registered they must be placed in to a resource pool. This is done
by first creating a pool:

```bash
serviced add-pool NAME CORE_LIMIT MEMORY_LIMIT PRIORITY
```



Dev Environment
---------------
Serviced is written in go. To install go, download go v1.1 from http://golang.org.
Untar the distribution to /usr/local/go. Ensure the following is in your environment

```bash
GOROOT=/usr/local/go
PATH="$PATH:$GOROOT/bin"
```

Setup a dev environment.

```bash
export GOPATH=~/mygo
export GOBIN=~/mygo/bin
mkdir $GOPATH/pkg -p
mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/zenoss -p
mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/mattbaird -p
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/mattbaird
git clone git@github.com:zenoss/elasticgo.git
cd elasticgo
go build install
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/zenoss
git clone git@github.com:zenoss/serviced.git
cd GOPATH/src/github.com/zenoss/serviced
make
```
