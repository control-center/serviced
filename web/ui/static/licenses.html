      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</a>

<h3>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</h3>
<p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to 
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this 
License (see Section&nbsp;10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary 
License (if permitted under the terms of Section&nbsp;3.3).</p>
<h3>2.5. Representation</h3>

<h2>3. Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
<h3>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</h3>
<p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including 
any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be 
under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the 
Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of 
this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. <a name="discriminationRestrictionLicense1">You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.</a></p>
<h3>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</h3>
<p><a name="openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense">If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</a></p><a name="openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense">
</a><ol type="a"><a name="openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense">
</a><li><a name="openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense"></a><p><a name="openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense">such
 Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as 
described in Section&nbsp;3.1, and You must inform recipients of the 
Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by 
reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost 
of distribution to the recipient</a>; and</p></li>
<li><p>You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that <a name="discriminationRestrictionLicense2">the
 license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the 
recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</a></p></li>
</ol>
<h3>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</h3>
<p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your 
choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this 
License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of
 Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary 
Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary 
Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such 
Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that 
the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further 
distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License 
or such Secondary License(s).</p>
<h3>3.4. Notices</h3>
<p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices 
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, 
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of 
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to 
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>
<h3>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</h3>
<p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered 
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on 
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any 
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional 
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any 
jurisdiction.</p></ul>
<h2>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</h2>
<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this 
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to 
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with 
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) 
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a 
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
<h2>5. Termination</h2>
<ul>
<p><b>5.1.</b> The rights granted under this License will terminate 
automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if 
You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a 
particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and 
until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, 
and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of 
the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You 
have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular 
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor 
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after 
Your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p><b>5.2.</b> <a name="patentRetaliationRestrictionLicense">If You 
initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent 
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, 
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version 
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to 
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under 
Section&nbsp;2.1 of this License shall terminate.</a></p>
<p><b>5.3.</b> In the event of termination under Sections&nbsp;5.1 or 
5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and 
resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors 
under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.</p></ul>
<h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
<p><b>Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" 
basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or 
statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered 
Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose 
or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of 
the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove 
defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of 
any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of 
warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any 
Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this 
disclaimer.</b></p>
<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p><b>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort 
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, 
or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable
 to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential 
damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost
 profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if 
such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. 
This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or 
personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent 
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not 
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential 
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</b></p>
<h2>8. Litigation</h2>
<p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the 
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal 
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that 
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. 
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring 
cross-claims or counter-claims.</p>
<h2>9. Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
 matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be 
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent 
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides 
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter 
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</p>
<h2>10. Versions of the License</h2>
<ul>
<h3>10.1. New Versions</h3>
<p>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in 
Section&nbsp;10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right 
to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be 
given a distinguishing version number.</p>
<h3>10.2. Effect of New Versions</h3>
<p>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the 
version of the License under which You originally received the Covered 
Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the 
license steward.</p>
<h3>10.3. Modified Versions</h3>
<p>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to 
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a 
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove 
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that 
such modified license differs from this License).</p>
<h3>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses</h3>
<p>If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible 
With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, 
the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.</p></ul>

    GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE ON
    BEHALF OF A LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE ACTUAL
    AUTHORITY TO AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF
    SUCH ENTITY.
</p>

    This Agreement is entered into by and between Elasticsearch BV ("Elastic") and
    You, or the legal entity on behalf of whom You are acting (as applicable,
    "You").

    SOFTWARE
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
    <b>1.1 Object Code End User License.</b>
    Subject to the terms and conditions of
    Section 1.2 of this Agreement, Elastic hereby grants to You, AT NO CHARGE and
    for so long as you are not in breach of any provision of this Agreement, a
    License to the Basic Features and Functions of the Elastic Software.
</p>
<p>
    <b>1.2 Reservation of Rights; Restrictions.</b>
    As between Elastic and You, Elastic
    and its licensors own all right, title and interest in and to the Elastic
    Software, and except as expressly set forth in Sections 1.1, and 2.1 of this
    Agreement, no other license to the Elastic Software is granted to You under
    this Agreement, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. You agree not to: (i)
    reverse engineer or decompile, decrypt, disassemble or otherwise reduce any
    Elastic Software provided to You in Object Code, or any portion thereof, to
    Source Code, except and only to the extent any such restriction is prohibited
    by applicable law, (ii) except as expressly permitted in this Agreement,
    prepare derivative works from, modify, copy or use the Elastic Software Object
    Code or the Commercial Software Source Code in any manner; (iii) except as
    expressly permitted in Section 1.1 above, transfer, sell, rent, lease,
    distribute, sublicense, loan or otherwise transfer, Elastic Software Object
    Code, in whole or in part, to any third party; (iv) use Elastic Software
    Object Code for providing time-sharing services, any software-as-a-service,
    service bureau services or as part of an application services provider or
    other service offering (collectively, "SaaS Offering") where obtaining access
    to the Elastic Software or the features and functions of the Elastic Software
    is a primary reason or substantial motivation for users of the SaaS Offering
    to access and/or use the SaaS Offering ("Prohibited SaaS Offering"); (v)
    circumvent the limitations on use of Elastic Software provided to You in
    Object Code format that are imposed or preserved by any License Key, or (vi)
    alter or remove any Marks and Notices in the Elastic Software. If You have any
    question as to whether a specific SaaS Offering constitutes a Prohibited SaaS
    Offering, or are interested in obtaining Elastic's permission to engage in
    commercial or non-commercial distribution of the Elastic Software, please
    contact elastic_license@elastic.co.
</p>
<p>
    <b>1.3 Third Party Open Source Software.</b>
    The Commercial Software may contain or
    be provided with third party open source libraries, components, utilities and
    other open source software (collectively, "Open Source Software"), which Open
    Source Software may have applicable license terms as identified on a website
    designated by Elastic. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, use of
    the Open Source Software shall be subject to the license terms and conditions
    applicable to such Open Source Software, to the extent required by the
    applicable licensor (which terms shall not restrict the license rights granted
    to You hereunder, but may contain additional rights). To the extent any
    condition of this Agreement conflicts with any license to the Open Source
    Software, the Open Source Software license will govern with respect to such
    Open Source Software only. Elastic may also separately provide you with
    certain open source software that is licensed by Elastic. Your use of such
    Elastic open source software will not be governed by this Agreement, but by
    the applicable open source license terms.

    2. COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE SOURCE CODE
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
    <b>2.1 Limited License.</b>
    Subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.2 of
    this Agreement, Elastic hereby grants to You, AT NO CHARGE and for so long as
    you are not in breach of any provision of this Agreement, a limited,
    non-exclusive, non-transferable, fully paid up royalty free right and license
    to the Commercial Software in Source Code format, without the right to grant
    or authorize sublicenses, to prepare Derivative Works of the Commercial
    Software, provided You (i) do not hack the licensing mechanism, or otherwise
    circumvent the intended limitations on the use of Elastic Software to enable
    features other than Basic Features and Functions or those features You are
    entitled to as part of a Subscription, and (ii) use the resulting object code
    only for reasonable testing purposes.
</p>
<p>
    <b>2.2 Restrictions.</b>
    Nothing in Section 2.1 grants You the right to (i) use the
    Commercial Software Source Code other than in accordance with Section 2.1
    above, (ii) use a Derivative Work of the Commercial Software outside of a
    Non-production Environment, in any production capacity, on a temporary or
    permanent basis, or (iii) transfer, sell, rent, lease, distribute, sublicense,
    loan or otherwise make available the Commercial Software Source Code, in whole
    or in part, to any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You may
    maintain a copy of the repository in which the Source Code of the Commercial
    Software resides and that copy may be publicly accessible, provided that you
    include this Agreement with Your copy of the repository.

        Upon any termination of this Agreement, for any reason,
        You shall promptly cease the use of the Elastic Software in Object Code format
        and cease use of the Commercial Software in Source Code format. For the
        avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement will not affect Your right
        to use Elastic Software, in either Object Code or Source Code formats, made
        available under the Apache License Version 2.0.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>3.3 Survival.</b>

        AND ELASTIC AND ITS LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES WHETHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR
        STATUTORY REGARDING OR RELATING TO THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT

    <p>
        <b>4.2 Limitation of Liability.</b>
        IN NO EVENT SHALL ELASTIC OR ITS LICENSORS BE

        INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS
        INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY
        SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, IN CONNECTION WITH
        OR ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE, OR THE
        PERFORMANCE OF OR FAILURE TO PERFORM THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A
        BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, EVEN IF ELASTIC
        HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    </p>
</ul>
<h2>
    5. MISCELLANEOUS
</h2>
<ul>
    <p>
        This Agreement completely and exclusively states the entire agreement of the
        parties regarding the subject matter herein, and it supersedes, and its terms
        govern, all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications between the
        parties, oral or written, regarding such subject matter. This Agreement may be
        modified by Elastic from time to time, and any such modifications will be
        effective upon the "Posted Date" set forth at the top of the modified
        Agreement. If any provision hereof is held unenforceable, this Agreement will
        continue without said provision and be interpreted to reflect the original
        intent of the parties. This Agreement and any non-contractual obligation
        arising out of or in connection with it, is governed exclusively by Dutch law.
        This Agreement shall not be governed by the 1980 UN Convention on Contracts
        for the International Sale of Goods. All disputes arising out of or in
        connection with this Agreement, including its existence and validity, shall be
        resolved by the courts with jurisdiction in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, except
        where mandatory law provides for the courts at another location in The
        Netherlands to have jurisdiction. The parties hereby irrevocably waive any and
        all claims and defenses either might otherwise have in any such action or
        proceeding in any of such courts based upon any alleged lack of personal
        jurisdiction, improper venue, forum non conveniens or any similar claim or
        defense. A breach or threatened breach, by You of Section 2 may cause
        irreparable harm for which damages at law may not provide adequate relief, and
        therefore Elastic shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief without being
        required to post a bond. You may not assign this Agreement (including by
        operation of law in connection with a merger or acquisition), in whole or in
        part to any third party without the prior written consent of Elastic, which
        may be withheld or granted by Elastic in its sole and absolute discretion.
        Any assignment in violation of the preceding sentence is void. Notices to
        Elastic may also be sent to legal@elastic.co.

<p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.</p>
<p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
